            Welcome to our website ...

            <br />
                <br />
             When our work began in 2000, our approach was simple. 
                <br />provided donated medical equipment from hospitals and clinics only across Jordan.
                <br/> over the past 22 years, we, thanks to many, have expanded our service globally,
                <br/>because we ultimately believe that where you live shouldn't determine whether you live.
                <br/>Today together we offer help to everyone in need .
